# Overview

**RecyclerGame** is an educational game made with Unity 2019.3.3f1 for Web browsers (WebGL). The game teaches you how to recycle different types of garbage. In the game, the player is driving through the city and visiting different garbage bins. When the player has visited a garbage point, he is prompted to choose how to recycle the garbage he has found. The game has a point system that is based on the number of correct recycling choices and the time it took the player to finish the game. 

Currently, the game is available only in the **Croatian language**, because there is an overwhelming lack of proper recycling in that country and I wanted to find a way to help solve that problem.
